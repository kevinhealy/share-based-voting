# Share Based Voting

There are many contexts, such as in a company, but also ranking content on social media, where a group of people vote to make a decision for another group of people.

...so in the case of a company, shareholders will vote to approve someone for a position in the company. 

...or on social media, users will “up vote on an article” so that it will appear at the top of everyone’s feed.

In both of these cases, a group has voted to make a decision for another group of people.

However, in the social media example it is currently a pure democratic vote... 
meaning everyone’s voting power is treated equal.  Whereas in a share based vote, some people have more weighted voting power, or sway, than others.

Direct democracies, or equal voting power, have the problem of drowning out an intelligent opinion with demagoguery... and therefore making an improper decision for the group.

Whereas, share based voting potentially allows those with more wisdom to influence a vote in a more harmonious way for the group, as they have more sway. (See my explanation of Ray Dalio’s weighted voted system: https://youtu.be/Jmr1ydA-VhQ?t=252 )

On the flip side, one could argue, if corrupted, it enables bad decisions to propagate faster, like what may happen in a monarchy if a corrupted son inherits the power.

However, assuming that some other process has resulted in the wisest people ending up with the most sway, share based voting is a more evolved and harmonious way of making group decisions.

So a simple, but very important, use case for blockchain would be to enable this voting power to be distributed to certain keys... and enable transferring of those shares among people.

This could be used in any context where a group of people is voting on some state change of data.
